    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have 4, so called, hobbies which I really like to do, hopefully in the same day, and they are : </p> <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Strength Training, which I always train at 
            <a href="https://palaciodeportesbenalmadena.com/">Palacio de Deportes Benalmadena.</a></li>
        <li>Walking, no matter where. I can be in nature, beach, cities, historical places.</li>
        <li>Playing video games, depends on my mood. Right now I started playing World of Warcraft.</li>
        <li>Last, but least, <a href="https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/"> Meditating </a>. I find meditation 
            the best way to close my day. It helps me with my
            concentration, better sleeping, healing myself etc. I recommend to anyone, no matter his ideas, religion, 
            age or gender. Healing is good for everyone.
        </li>    
    </ul>
